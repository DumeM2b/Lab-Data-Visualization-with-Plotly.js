# Seismic Data Visualization with Plotly.js

## Description
This project involves using the Plotly.js library to create interactive visualizations of seismic data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using JavaScript, we will retrieve live data from the USGS API, process it to extract information such as latitude, longitude, magnitude, time, and depth of earthquakes. This data will then be used to create various types of charts, including a world map of earthquake locations, a histogram of magnitudes, a time series of earthquake occurrences, and a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between magnitude and depth of earthquakes.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the process of retrieving, processing, and visualizing data from a live API using Plotly.js. By completing this project, we will strengthen our skills in JavaScript programming, data manipulation, and creation of interactive charts.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of the project, we will have developed an interactive web page that displays dynamic and informative charts about global seismic activity over the past week. This experience will enhance our understanding of data visualization concepts and their application in the fields of geology and geophysics.
